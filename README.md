The Water Quality Prediction Model is a machine learning-based solution designed to estimate water pollution levels using environmental factors such as Air Quality Index (AQI) and PM2.5 concentration. The model leverages historical data to establish correlations between air pollution and water quality, providing a quick and reliable method for water pollution assessment.
